Hello and welcome to my personal web page. I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics, University of Alicante Spain](http://fae.ua.es/). I am also a World Bank [Africa Fellow](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/brief/world-bank-group-africa-fellowship-program) where I work as an economic consultant to the [Energy & Extractives Global Practice](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy).

In the summer of 2020, I was a [PhD Intern](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Recruitment/working-at-the-imf/fund-internship-program) with the Africa Department of the International Monetary Fund. 

My research interests are Sustainable Economic Growth and Development with a special focus on the role of natural resources in economic development. I'm also interested in using spatial and micro data to answer macro-development questions. On this site you will find information relating to my [research](research.md) and other activities. Cheers!!!
