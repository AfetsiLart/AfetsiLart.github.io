Hello and welcome to my personal web page. I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics, University of Alicante Spain](http://fae.ua.es/). My research interests are Sustainable Economic Growth and Development with a special focus on the role of natural resources in economic development. I'm also interested in using micro data to answer macro-development questions.
In the summer of 2020, I was a [PhD Intern](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Recruitment/working-at-the-imf/fund-internship-program) with the International Monetary Fund. Beginning Januaray 2021, I will be working with the World Bank's Energy and Extractives Global Practice as an [economic consultant](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/brief/world-bank-group-africa-fellowship-program).
On this site you will find information relating to my Research and other activities. Cheers!!!
